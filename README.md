# cinema-engine
An OpenGL graphics engine built in C++

Cinema Engine is a personal project made as a final project for CSE 167 at the University of California San Diego. This project takes graphics inspiration from modern video games such as *Death Stranding* and *Red Dead Redemption 2* where they implement cinematic experiences. A deferred rendering pipeline is used and lighting is processed in screen space. Post-processing effects such as motion blur, bloom and fog are also implemented.

Development process is outlined in [this blog](https://cinemaengine.movie.blog/) and a demonstration of the engine can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1I4iNAFo1XA).
